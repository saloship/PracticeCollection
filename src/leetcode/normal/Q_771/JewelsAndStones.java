    * You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.
    * Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

     The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive,
     so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

      Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
      Output: 3

      Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
      Output: 0
